Action Update : 

Only thing matters: the fight!
You must fight against the brutal aliens who are constantly chasing you.

You must fight for the food. There’s only a few and others want it as well. 
You must fight against the low ammunition. There’s few of it and they run out quickly in a battle.
You must fight against your condition. There are not enough medicines so you had better not hurt yourself.
But you will... And finally, you must fight against yourself to don’t give up...


Update : Atmosphere :

There are many dangers involved in this enormous open world.
Because of the alien bacteria, that are deadly to all living things on earth, it’s recommended to wear protective equipment.
If you choose to avoid them, you still need to be careful!
In the destroyed towns and woods there are plenty of aliens who are waiting to catch you...
Because of these, and many other things, No More Light has a very depressing, post-apocalyptic atmosphere, which will captivate you from the first moment..


Invaders Update : 

They are traveling the galaxy for thousands of years,
invading every planet to take them for themselves, and move on.
Earth and humanity is next. Their technology is more advanced, they are multiple times more powerful,
than the humans, and they have thousands of years of experience in galactic warfare.
Because they live FOR war, because they live FROM war.
